    "[SymPy](http://sympy.org) is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is intended to cover the basics as well as touch on more advanced topics. We will start with the basics of constructing and manipulating mathematical expressions in SymPy. We will also discuss the most common issues and differences from other computer algebra systems, and how to deal with them. In the remaining part of this tutorial we will show how to solve mathematical problems with SymPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This knowledge should be enough for attendees to start using SymPy for solving mathematical problems and hacking SymPy's internals (though hacking core modules may require additional expertise).\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect attendees of this tutorial to have basic knowledge of Python and mathematics.\n",
